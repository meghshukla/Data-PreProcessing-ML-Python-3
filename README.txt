Submission as a part of Machine Learning Assignment, EE769 Machine Learning (IIT Bombay)

Aim: Data pre-processing for machine learning applications, includes dealing with missing data,
class imabalances. Pre-proceesing includes statistical and Principal component analysis techniques.
The processed data is then passed through machine learning algorithms such as Linear Discriminant Analysis,
Support Vector Machines, Random Forest and Neural Networks. Various categorical data transformation 
techniques have been implemented, such as One-Hot encoding, Binary encoding, and simple categorical
to ordinal conversion.

About the dataset:
Based on Kaggle's advanced housing regression problem, the difference is that the dataset is modified 
to classification problem instead of regression. Classification into 3 categories: 'Sold Slow',
'Sold Fast' and 'Not Sold'. Dataset has missing values, and class distribution is skewed. Training
set has 1400 samples, approximately same with Testing set.
Running the training testing process repeatedly actually shows the effect of 'No Free Lunch theorem',
which states that with certain probability the classifier will make some error if the training and testing set
are roughly equal in cardinality.

Instructions :
Folder : Hyperparameter data consists of Grid Search results over specified hyperparameters for each classifier
Folder : Models includes trained classifiers saved as pickle files, includes PCA pickle too for Neural Network 
         and Random Forest
Folder : Prediction stores output of classifiers based on testing data input
File : gt.csv (Actual GrounD Truth of Test.csv hidden from classifier)
File : testsold/trainsold.csv is the Training and Testing data for the classifers
File : ModifiedIP.csv is the post-processing file generated by combining testSold and trainSold
File : Report.pdf which is a report to explain the findings generated by solving the problem. 

File : train.py / test.py used for Training the classifier and Testing the classifier

Run train.py, followed by test.py 


1) Please change directory variable given at line 26 (train.py) and line 19 (test.py) of the code.
   That directory refers to the location I saved these files on  my computer. 
   All the models/data which are saved/loaded by the 
   code are relative to this directory. Hence you need to update 
   this directory ONLY at one place. The directory should be
   folder where train.py/test.py etc are saved
